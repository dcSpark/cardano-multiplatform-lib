This crate is for the general-purpose WASM package. We don't have WASM packages for every single crate due to shared dependencies not being possible, so using, for example, cml-cip25-wasm + cml-cip36-wasm + cml-chain-wasm together would result in 3 copies of cml-chain-wasm that are not compatible with each other. This crate combines all wasm crates except for cml-multi-era-wasm (due to size reasons) together in one place and as such has no equivalent rust crate.
