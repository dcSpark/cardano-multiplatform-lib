// In order to have wasm-bindgen export types we need to import at least one type
// from each other crate.
// We can't use pub use cml_foo_wasm::*; as that will generate a warning due to
// multiple of them including a utils module so we just import an arbitrary type.
// We don't need to worry about cml_core_wasm and cml_crypto_wasm since they
// will be exported by the other crates here.
