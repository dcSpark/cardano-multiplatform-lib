# Crate Architecture

- **Core** - Core types common throughout all CML crates.

- **Chain** - Current era on-chain types, plus utility functionality and builders for creating these types. This is likely the crate most users will want to use.

- **Crypto** - Crypto primitives used throughout CML. Keys, signatures, etc.

- **CIP25** - Library for working with CIP25 NFT metadata.

- **CIP36** - Library for working with CIP36 (catalyst) registration types.

- **Multi-Era** - On-chain types for previous eras (Byron, Shelley, Alonzo, Babbage, etc) plus era-agnostic wrappers around this for parsing historical blockchain data.
