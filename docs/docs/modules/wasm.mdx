# WASM Usage

## Memory Management

If you are using CML from the browser this section is likely irrelevant for you.
Using CML from a javascript environment with weakrefs enabled should have automatic memory cleanup.
If this is not the case (e.g. non-javascript/typescript WASM environment), or you are using CML inside of a very tight loop that is executed hundreds of thousands of times in a short period it might be advisable to explicitly call `.free()` on any CML types after they are used.
This is because while from an environment with weakrefs the types will eventually be freed automatically,
it is still possible to use excessive memory or run out if, for example, large CML types are created in a constant loop that runs many times (e.g. hundreds of thousands of times without a break), as the automatic cleanup will not be run in time. Do not worry about this for normal CML usage.
Do not call `.free()` on a type or use it after `.free()` has been called on it already.
WASM types passed into other CML APIs will be done so by reference and will not have their `.free()` method called just by doing so, but will still eventually be cleaned up if weakrefs are available.
