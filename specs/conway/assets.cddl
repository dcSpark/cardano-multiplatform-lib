; these two are technically hand-written but we keep them here so that other code can
; continue thinking they're maps and handle them like so (encoding details, etc)
; they will just invoke the Deref trait on the hand-written object anyway.
; So the hand-written part is more of a wrapper over the type defined below
; NOTE: this means that after generation you must unfortunately manually remove Mint
; MultiAsset doesn't need removing since it's only referenced by Value which is also
; externally defined.
