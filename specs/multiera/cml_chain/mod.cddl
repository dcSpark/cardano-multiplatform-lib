; this module is structured so that imports won't have to be changed at all.
; just replace use crate::cml_chain::{foo, bar, etc...} with use cml_chain::{foo, bar, etc...}
; some types aren't _CDDL_CODEGEN_EXTERN_TYPE_ or _CDDL_CODEGEN_RAW_BYTES_TYPE_
; and instead have their original definitions.
; this is in places where _CDDL_CODEGEN_EXTERN_TYPE_ needs the extra type info
; to be able to remember encodings (needs to know type and where to store the info
; since you can't just call member.serialize() generically and have it remember the encodings
; for when the encodings aren't interally stored (primtives mostly)).
; so just delete the cml_chain directory afterwards and change the import crate with ctrl-r.
